# SimplePart

For this assignment, I chose to refactor it with React as that's what I've been using a lot lately. Pretty straightforward, the biggest hurdle was getting webpack to play nice with the provided assets.

## Instructions

- "It's time to show off your skills and determination. You are being asked to refactor this statically generated site into a project using the tech stack requested in the invite (i.e. VueJs, LESS, etc.). There will also be additional tech requests in the invite so please pay close attention and implement the features requested."

- Implement using whatever framework/library you chooses (react, vuejs, node, mvc, etc)

- All styling must be done with LESS files and compiled into a single file that used by the site

- This task should not consume more than 4 hours of your time

- Once you are done please push your working repository up to your personal GitHub account and send us a link for review
